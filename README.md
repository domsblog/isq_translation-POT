# ∞² internationalisation for translators

If you want to help Infinity Squared and translate it into other languages, you can download the POT file here (repo will be up in a second). If you need some help with the technical side of translations, [this README](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS.pot) will prove very useful. The only difference is that your files need to be named isq_translation-locate.type, for example isq_translation-pl_PL.po.

Once you've translated it, the best option is to store a tracked repository, like Git or SVN, and pinging me either by [creating an issue](https://github.com/tomslominski/infinity-squared/issues/new) or [emailing me](mailto:me@tomslominski.net) so that I can add your translation to the project and list it on this page. Your help will be greatly appreciated, and do not hesitate to email me if you encounter any issues.
